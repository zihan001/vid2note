00:00:00.320 structured query language sql or sql for
00:00:03.439 short is the gold standard language for
00:00:05.600 communicating with relational database
00:00:07.520 management systems you've likely heard
00:00:09.280 of databases like mysql
00:00:11.280 postgres microsoft sql server and oracle
00:00:14.240 all of which are based on sql with their
00:00:16.160 own little variations
00:00:17.359 it was initially developed in the early
00:00:19.039 70s to mutate and retrieve data from
00:00:21.600 ibm's system r database by 1986
00:00:24.800 it was standardized into the syntax that
00:00:26.960 remains extremely popular in technical
00:00:28.880 applications today a relational database
00:00:31.119 organizes data into tables
00:00:33.120 kind of like an excel spreadsheet where
00:00:34.960 columns contain attributes or types of
00:00:36.960 data
00:00:37.440 while each row represents an individual
00:00:39.440 record or data point with its own unique
00:00:41.600 id
00:00:42.000 known as a primary key we can establish
00:00:44.320 relationships between data points
00:00:46.239 by taking the unique id from one row and
00:00:48.399 storing it on a different row in a
00:00:50.160 different table
00:00:50.960 in a special column known as a foreign
00:00:53.120 key in the teams table the team id
00:00:55.199 is the primary key but in the players
00:00:57.199 table it's the foreign key
00:00:58.800 and what that data structure tells us is
00:01:00.719 that a player belongs to one team
00:01:02.960 while a team can have many players what
00:01:05.438 we've done here
00:01:06.159 is structured our data in its smallest
00:01:08.240 normal form to eliminate duplication and
00:01:10.560 redundancy
00:01:11.520 now the role of sql is not only to read
00:01:14.560 create
00:01:15.119 update and delete data but also to join
00:01:17.759 data together
00:01:18.720 based on the relationships embedded
00:01:20.320 within it the syntax
00:01:21.759 is comprised of several key parts if we
00:01:24.240 zoom all the way out
00:01:25.280 we have a statement or a piece of code
00:01:27.439 that does something
00:01:28.400 like reads or writes to the database
00:01:30.400 within a statement we have a variety of
00:01:32.320 keywords that can manipulate the
00:01:33.920 database
00:01:34.640 select can be used to make a query for
00:01:36.880 the columns that you want
00:01:38.159 from a table the column and table names
00:01:41.040 are known as
00:01:41.840 identifiers but we may not want every
00:01:43.920 row in the table so we filter the
00:01:45.439 results with the where keyword to only
00:01:47.280 include records that meet a certain
00:01:48.799 condition
00:01:49.439 it's like looping over every row in the
00:01:51.119 table and only returning rows in the
00:01:52.720 query where the predicate evaluates to
00:01:54.560 true
00:01:55.119 then we might use the join keyword to
00:01:57.119 connect data from an entirely different
00:01:58.719 table
00:01:59.360 by matching the primary key on this
00:02:01.119 table to the foreign key on another
00:02:03.040 table
00:02:03.600 what we've created is a collection of
00:02:05.439 clauses that make up
00:02:06.960 a full sql statement we can now go and
00:02:09.280 execute this code on the hundreds of
00:02:10.800 different databases that support
00:02:12.400 sql this has been structured query
00:02:14.400 language in 100 seconds
